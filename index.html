          Mushroom foraging is the art and science of identifying and collecting
          wild mushrooms.

        <p>
          It's a practice that combines outdoor exploration, botanical
          knowledge, and culinary adventure. Foragers venture into forests,
          fields, and even urban green spaces to discover these hidden
          treasures.
        </p>
        <p>
          But beware – this hobby requires careful study and respect for nature,
          as some mushrooms can be dangerous if misidentified.
